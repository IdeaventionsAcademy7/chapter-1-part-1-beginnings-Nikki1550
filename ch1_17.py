something_str = input ("Enter something: ")
print (something_str)
something_int = int (something_str)
print (something_int)
something_float = float (something_str)
print (something_float)

# Answers: 
# You can input positive ingeters and print without an error because it can be
# printed out as a string, integer, and a float.

# You cannot print out any letters without getting an error of invalid literal
# for int() or float() because they can't convert a letter into an integer.
